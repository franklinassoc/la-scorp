Louisiana Office of State Parks - SCORP

SCORP is the Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Program which identifies recreational needs and issues existing throughout the state of Louisiana. The document, updated every 5 years, outlines a plan for balancing environmental conservation with providing recreational facilities and provides key information for determining the distribution of federal grant funds. SCORPs occur nationally, being a requirement of the federal government to perform or update a SCORP in each state every five years.
